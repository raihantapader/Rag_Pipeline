Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30].

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

Raihan Tapader, Md. Mostafizer Rahman, Ariful Islam Shiplu, Md Faizul Ibne Amin, and Yutaka Watanobe\\nAbstract—In today’s world, the focus of programmers has\\nshifted from writing complex, error-prone code to prioritizing\\nsimple, clear, efficient, and sustainable code that makes programs\\neasier to understand. Code refactoring plays a critical role\\nin this transition by improving structural organization and\\noptimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods\\nare limited in their ability to generalize across multiple pro-\\ngramming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on\\nmanually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this\\nstudy are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)\\n-based framework capable of performing accurate and effi-\\ncient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#,\\nPython, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering\\n(Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-\\ntuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality\\nimprovements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity,\\nNumber of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in\\nrefactored code through empirical metrics and human assess-\\nment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-\\nengineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for\\nmultilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that\\nJava achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the\\n10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of\\n94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high\\nsimilarity (≈53–54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance\\nbetween structural modifications and semantic preservation.\\nPython exhibits the lowest structural distance across all shots\\n(≈277–294) while achieving moderate similarity (≈44–48%) that\\nindicates consistent and minimally disruptive refactoring. C#\\nconsistently preserves semantic content, achieving up to 57.63%\\nsimilarity at 10-shot, despite larger structural changes. C and\\nC++ show moderate distances (≈266–338) and variable similarity\\n(36–55%), reflecting more unpredictable outcomes.\\nIndex Terms—Large Language Model, prompt engineering,\\ncode refactoring, API, fine-tuning, zero-shot prompting, few-shot\\nprompting.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nNow-a-days, there is intense competition among program-\\nmers to write highly optimized code. The goal is to make\\ncode simple, concise, and easy to understand so that everyone\\nfrom beginners to experts can read and maintain it effortlessly.\\nMd.

However, achieving this balance has become significant\\nchallenge because reducing execution time often increases\\nmemory uses, and vice versa. To address this, programmers\\ncontinuously work on refactoring their code, improving earlier\\nversions by removing redundancies, reducing the number of\\nlines and tokens, and making the logic clearer. Code refac-\\ntoring not only enhances performance but also improves code\\nreadability, maintainability, and adaptability to future changes\\nas shown in Figure 1.\\nOver the few decades, code refactoring has evolved from\\nbeing a purely manual and experience-driven practice to a\\nsystematic process supported by automated tools and frame-\\nworks. Early refactoring methods focused mainly on syntactic\\ntransformations, such as renaming variables, extracting meth-\\nods, or eliminating duplicate code. Tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ\\nIDEA, and other integrated development environments (IDEs)\\nhave helped standardize these transformation for making them\\naccessible to a broader range of developers. However, as\\nsoftware systems have grown in size and complexity, the\\nlimitations of purely rule-based approaches have become ap-\\nparent. Researchers have explored program analysis techniques\\nsuch as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs\\n(CFGs), and static analysis to detect code smells and suggest\\nimprovements.\\nMore recently, machine learning and deep learning models\\nhave been applied to learn refactoring patterns from large-scale\\nrepositories to move beyond the surface-level changes toward\\ndeeper structural and semantic optimization [1]–[3].

Furthermore, there remains significant gap in supporting\\nrefactoring across diverse programming languages and in\\nsystematically exploring refactoring tasks that have yet to be\\nthoroughly investigated.

METHODOLOGY\\nIn this section, we provide a detailed description of our\\nautomated code refactoring model, which combines fine-\\ntuned prompt engineering with few-shot learning to improve\\naccuracy, efficiency, and generalizability.

Each prompt consists of three\\nkey components: a custom instruction that highlights specific\\nfeatures as illustrated in Figure 4, along with a complex code\\nsnippet and its corresponding refactored version. Next, we\\noutline the prompting strategies employed in our methodology,\\nwhich include zero-shot, two-shot, four-shot, and few-shot\\nprompting. In zero-shot prompting, only the instruction is\\nprovided without any accompanying examples. Conversely,\\ntwo-shot, four-shot, and few-shot prompting incorporate two,\\nfour, and several relevant examples respectively, alongside\\nthe instruction. During the learning phase, the input code\\nis supplied to a large language model (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo)\\ntogether with few-shot examples for instruction fine-tuning.\\nThe model learns the transformation patterns from the prompts\\nFig. 3: Demonstration of model behavior: (1) instruction inter-\\npertation, (2) refactoring responses to input program based on\\nsystem instructions, and (3) error handling proficiency when\\nrefactoring erroneous program.

It is defined in Equation 1,\\nwhere n is the total samples, c is the correct samples, and k\\nis the evaluated samples, satisfying n ≥k and c ≤n rules.\\nSpecifically, Pass@1 measures how often the first output is\\ncorrect, while Pass@10 checks if at least one of the top 10\\noutputs is correct [12].\\nPass@k := E\\n\"\\n1 −\\n\\x00n−c\\nk\\n\\x01\\n\\x00n\\nk\\n\\x01\\n#\\n(1)\\n2) Correct@k: In this paper, we create Correct@k metric\\nas the ratio of correct outputs among the top-k generated\\nresults using few-shot prompting, as shown in Equation 2.\\nThis metric is specifically designed to assess the correctness of\\nthe k generated samples, where n represents the total number\\nof generated outputs, e denotes the number of erroneous\\nones, and (n −e) indicates the number of correct outputs.\\nThe parameter k controls the level at which correctness is\\nmeasured.\\nCorrect@k =\\n(\\n100%,\\nk ≤(n −e),\\nn−e\\nk ,\\nk > (n −e).\\n(2)\\nFor each new input code snippet Ci, we generate n = 5\\nrefactored versions and evaluate correctness using Correct@k,\\nwhere k ∈{1, 2, . . . , 5}. In this work, Correct@1 refers to\\nthe proportion in which at least one of the generated outputs\\nis correct, whereas Correct@5 reflects the cases where all\\nfive outputs are correct. Subsequently, if a generated code Ri\\nsatisfies the correctness criteria defined by the equation, the\\nsuccess rate is computed accordingly.\\n3) McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity(CC): is a software\\nmetric used to measure the number of linearly indepen-\\ndent paths through a program’s source code. It quantifies\\nthe program complexity by counting the number of deci-\\nsion points(e.g., if statements, while loops, for loops, switch\\nstatements) in the code [17]. A lower CC is preferable and\\nmakes the code easier to understand and maintain in software\\ndevelopment. We employed a custom AST-based library to\\naccurately compute the CC for both correct and incorrect code\\nsamples.\\n4) Compilability: refers to whether a generated program is\\nsyntactically correct and successfully compiles, reflecting the\\nmodel’s capabilities to produce valid and executable code It\\nis calculated as equation 3:\\nCompilability =\\n\\x10\\nP\\nP + E\\n\\x11\\n× 100%\\n(3)\\nwhere P denotes the number of programs that compile\\nsuccessfully, and E denotes the number of programs that\\nfail to compile. In our case, the comparability of the com-\\nplex(original) programs used for refactoring is 100%, as all of\\nthem were correct and problem-solved.\\n5) Lines of Code (LOC): is a software metric that measures\\nthe number of lines in a source code. In this work, we use\\nSource Lines of Code (SLOC), which excludes comments,\\nblank lines, and structural braces (e.g.,{ }), focusing solely\\non the actual executable statements. For refactoring analysis,\\nSLOC is preferred over raw LOC because it avoids inflated\\ncounts from non-functional lines and gives a more accurate\\npicture of the actual number of lines and logic implemented\\nrather than comments or empty lines.\\n6) Chars: refers to the total length of how much character\\nis used in a code on average. This matrix sometimes yields\\nanomalous values due to long string literals, comments, and\\nexcessive whitespace. To accurately measure the character\\nlength, we normalize the refactored code by removing such\\nanomalies. For example, consider the string literals:\\nA=’Enter a num:’ and B= ”H”; these would initially result in\\ndifferent character counts. However, after normalization, both\\nare treated equivalently as A = ’ ’ and B = ” ”, leading to\\nconsistent and fair character length comparisons.\\n7) Tokens: refers to the total length of how many tokens\\nare used in a code on average. Tokens are the fundamental\\ncomponents of a program that the compiler processes. In this\\nwork, we used an official Python tokenizer for Python code,\\nwhile for other languages, we employed a regex-based tok-\\nenizer. To ensure accurate token counts, all code snippets are\\nnormalized by removing comments, newlines, and indentation\\nbefore tokenization.\\n8) Levenshtein Distance: also known as edit distance, is\\na string metric that quantifies the difference between two\\nsequences (typically strings) by counting the minimum number\\nof single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions)\\nrequired to transform one string into the other. In this study,'),\n",

Results\\nWe conducted comprehensive experiments across multiple\\nprogramming languages using a fine-tuned large language\\nmodel with few-shot prompting to assess its effectiveness in\\nautomated code refactoring. Table I summarizes key code qual-\\nity metrics—Compilability, CC, LOC, Chars, and token count\\nfor five programming languages (C, C++, C#, Python, and\\nJava) evaluated under different few-shot prompting scenarios\\nranging from 0-shot to 10-shot.\\nIn the 0-shot baseline, compilability ranges narrowly be-\\ntween 88.67% (C#) and 92.67% (C++) which indicates that\\neven without examples, the model maintains reasonable syn-\\ntactic consistency. CC is relatively stable for C, C++, and C#\\naround 5.0, while Python and Java generate simpler control\\nflows with lower complexity 2.10 and 3.32, respectively. The\\nrefactored programs at this stage are compact, mostly between\\n6–8 lines of code and 200–290 characters, with Python being\\nthe most concise in token count 123.71. Introducing two\\nexample prompts significantly alters the compilability trends\\nacross languages. While C experiences a decline to 83%\\ncompilability, higher-level managed languages such as C#,\\nPython, and Java demonstrate notable improvements, reaching\\ncompilability rates of 94% and above. Concurrently, LOC\\nincrease modestly for all languages, with particularly pro-\\nnounced growth in C# (11.02 lines) and Java (8.59 lines),\\nreflecting longer and potentially more detailed function im-\\nplementations. Corresponding increases are also observed in\\ncharacter and token counts, consistent with the enhanced\\ncode elaboration. At the 4-shot prompting level, compilability\\nstabilizes across languages, with C# achieving the highest rate\\nof 97.33%. Python’s CC further decreases to 1.79, indicating\\nthe generation of highly linear and simplified code structures.\\nMeanwhile, C++ and Java exhibit increased verbosity, each\\nsurpassing 260 characters on average. C# continues to show\\nthe greatest increase in LOC, reaching 11.64 lines, suggesting\\nthat the model tends to produce more descriptive or boilerplate\\ncode when provided with additional contextual examples. A\\nnotable shift in trends emerges at the 6-shot prompting level.\\nJava attains a compilability of 96%, closely followed by C# at\\n96.67%. In contrast, Python experiences a significant decline\\nto 87.33%, reversing its previous stability. Interestingly, C++\\nexhibits a marked reduction in cyclomatic complexity to 2.58,\\nindicating that additional examples encourage the model to'),\n",

Python shows the largest drop, from 5.00 to 2.28,\\nimplying that LLM refactoring may employ more linear or flat-\\ntened logic structures in dynamic languages. A major change is\\nobserved in code length metrics. All refactored programs show\\na significant reduction in Lines of Code, with average LOC\\ndropping from 18–21 lines to approximately 7–10 lines across\\nall languages. This compression effect is further reflected\\nin character count and token count, both of which decrease\\nsharply. For instance, Java reduces from 487 to 288 characters,\\nand Python from 407 to 268, while token counts drop from\\n≈180 down to ≈150 or lower. Interestingly, C# and Java retain\\nhigher CC values while achieving moderate LOC reductions\\nwhich suggestes that the model preserves structural richness\\nwhile shortening syntax.

In contrast, Java and C# frequently\\nexhibit the highest distances, particularly at higher shots,\\nreaching up to 509.93 for Java at 6-shot that reflects more\\nsubstantial structural modifications during refactoring. C and\\nC++ generally maintain moderate distances, suggesting that\\nwhile the structural changes are noticeable, they are not\\nas extreme as those observed for Java or C#. In terms of\\nsimilarity, C# consistently achieves the highest mean values,\\npeaking at 57.63% under 10-shot prompting that indicates\\nthat despite larger structural changes, the semantic and lexical\\ncontent is largely retained. Java also maintains high similarity\\nvalues at higher shots (≈53–54%) that highlights its ability to\\nbalance structural changes with semantic preservation. Python\\nexhibits moderate similarity values (≈44–48%), which, com-\\nbined with its low distance, that indicates that the refactoring\\nis consistent and minimally disruptive. C and C++ display\\nvariable similarity across shots, with mean values ranging\\nfrom 36% to 55% that reflects less predictable outcomes\\ndepending on the shot configuration. Examining shot-wise\\ntrends, low-shot settings (0–2 shots) generally result in higher\\ndistances and lower similarity for most languages which\\nsuggests that minimal examples are insufficient to guide the\\nmodel effectively. Moderate-shot settings (4–6 shots) tend to\\nimprove both metrics and achieve a better balance between\\nstructural fidelity and semantic preservation. At high-shot\\nsettings (8–10 shots), Python maintains low distance, while C#\\nand Java continue to achieve high similarity which highlights\\nthe optimal shot configuration depends on the language and\\ndesired outcome. Overall, Python is the most structurally\\nconsistent across all shots, C# preserves semantic content most\\neffectively, and Java provides a balanced trade-off between\\nstructural modification and semantic similarity at higher shots,\\nemphasizing the importance of language-specific strategies and\\nshot configurations in automated code refactoring.\\nV. CONCLUSION\\nThis study presents a comprehensive investigation into the\\neffectiveness of LLMs for multilingual code refactoring across\\nC, C++, C#, Python, and Java. By designing a prompting\\nmodule with ten distinct prompts and employing zero-shot,\\nfew-shot, and multi-shot strategies, we fine-tuned the model\\nto generate high-quality refactored code while preserving\\nsemantic correctness.

As\\nwe pre-train larger models, full ﬁne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example – deploying indepen-\\ndent instances of ﬁne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\\nexpensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B ﬁne-tuned with Adam,\\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than ﬁne-\\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\\nno additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into\\nrank-deﬁciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efﬁcacy of\\nLoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch\\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPretrained \\nWeights\\n𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\nx\\nh\\n𝐵= 0\\n𝐴= 𝒩(0, 𝜎2)\\n𝑑\\n𝑟\\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\\ntion.

Such adaptation is usually done via ﬁne-tuning,\\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-\\njor downside of ﬁne-tuning is that the new model contains as many\\nparameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained\\nevery few months, this changes from a mere “inconvenience” for\\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a\\ncritical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with\\n175 billion trainable parameters.1\\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or\\nlearning external modules for new tasks.

More importantly, these method often fail to\\nmatch the ﬁne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efﬁciency and model quality.\\nWe take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned\\nover-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the\\nchange in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed\\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural\\nnetwork indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during\\nadaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3\\n175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., r in Figure 1 can be one or two) sufﬁces even\\nwhen the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efﬁcient.\\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\\n• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-\\nferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efﬁciently switch tasks by replacing the\\nmatrices A and B in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-\\nhead signiﬁcantly.\\n• LoRA makes training more efﬁcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\\n• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully ﬁne-tuned model, by\\nconstruction.\\n• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\\nas preﬁx-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\\nTerminologies and Conventions\\nWe make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions.\\nWe call the input and output di-\\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel.\\nWe use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the\\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-\\ntrained weight matrix and ∆W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to\\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 × dmodel.\\n2\\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speciﬁc prompt.\\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model PΦ(y|x) parametrized by Φ.\\nFor instance, PΦ(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\\nreading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is\\nrepresented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z = {(xi, yi)}i=1,..,N, where both xi and\\nyi are sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, xi is a natural language query and yi its\\ncorresponding SQL command; for summarization, xi is the content of an article and yi its summary.\\n2'),\n",

Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efﬁcient. See Sec-\\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to efﬁcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\\net al., 2019; Rebufﬁet al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R¨uckl´e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency\\nThere are many variants of adapters. We focus\\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\\ning multi-task settings (R¨uckl´e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\\nthe extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep-\\nikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as\\nAllReduce and Broadcast, unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard\\nThe other direction, as exempliﬁed by preﬁx tuning (Li\\n& Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that preﬁx tuning is difﬁcult to optimize\\nand that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, conﬁrming similar\\nobservations in the original paper.

The inference latency introduced by adapter layers can be signiﬁcant in an\\nonline, short-sequence-length scenario. See the full study in Appendix B.\\n4\\nOUR METHOD\\nWe describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical beneﬁts. The principles outlined here apply\\nto any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer\\nlanguage models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\\n4.1\\nLOW-RANK-PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES\\nA neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight\\nmatrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a speciﬁc task, Aghajanyan et al.\\n(2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low “instrisic dimension” and can still\\nlearn efﬁciently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothe-\\nsize the updates to the weights also have a low “intrinsic rank” during adaptation. For a pre-trained\\nweight matrix W0 ∈Rd×k, we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank de-\\ncomposition W0 + ∆W = W0 + BA, where B ∈Rd×r, A ∈Rr×k, and the rank r ≪min(d, k).\\nDuring training, W0 is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while A and B contain trainable\\nparameters. Note both W0 and ∆W = BA are multiplied with the same input, and their respective\\noutput vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h = W0x, our modiﬁed forward pass yields:\\nh = W0x + ∆Wx = W0x + BAx\\n(3)\\nWe illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for A and\\nzero for B, so ∆W = BA is zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ∆Wx by α\\nr , where α\\nis a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning α is roughly the same as tuning the learning\\nrate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set α to the ﬁrst r we try\\nand do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary\\nr (Yang & Hu, 2021).\\nA Generalization of Full Fine-tuning.\\nA more general form of ﬁne-tuning allows the training of\\na subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumu-\\nlated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when\\napplying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressive-\\nness of full ﬁne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank r to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In\\nother words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3, training LoRA roughly converges\\nto training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and preﬁx-based\\nmethods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\\nNo Additional Inference Latency.\\nWhen deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and\\nstore W = W0 + BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0 and BA are in Rd×k.\\nWhen we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0 by subtracting BA and\\nthen adding a different B′A′, a quick operation with very little memory overhead. Critically, this\\n2They represent a negligible number of parameters compared to weights.\\n3An inevitability when adapting to hard tasks.\\n4'),\n",

In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in\\nthe self-attention module (Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treat Wq (or Wk, Wv)\\nas a single matrix of dimension dmodel ×dmodel, even though the output dimension is usually sliced\\ninto attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream\\ntasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity\\nand parameter-efﬁciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight\\nmatrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP\\nlayers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\\nPractical Beneﬁts and Limitations.\\nThe most signiﬁcant beneﬁt comes from the reduction in\\nmemory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM\\nusage by up to 2/3 if r ≪dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen\\nparameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to\\n350GB. With r = 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint\\nsize is reduced by roughly 10,000× (from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with signiﬁ-\\ncantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another beneﬁt is that we can switch between tasks\\nwhile deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the\\nparameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out\\non the ﬂy on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup\\nduring training on GPT-3 175B compared to full ﬁne-tuning5 as we do not need to calculate the\\ngradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\\nLoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks\\nwith different A and B in a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb A and B into W to eliminate\\nadditional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose\\nthe LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\\n5\\nEMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nWe evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), De-\\nBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown\\net al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding\\n(NLU) to generation (NLG). Speciﬁcally, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark\\nfor RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct com-\\nparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al.,\\n2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for\\nmore details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\\n5.1\\nBASELINES\\nTo compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their\\nreported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear\\nin certain experiments.\\nFine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. During ﬁne-tuning, the model is initialized\\nto the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple\\nvariant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported\\nin prior work (Li & Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers (FTTop2).\\n4We still need the 350GB model during deployment; however, storing 100 adapted models only requires\\n350GB + 35MB * 100 ≈354GB as opposed to 100 * 350GB ≈35TB.\\n5For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full ﬁne-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same\\nnumber of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.\\n5'),\n",

(2019) for a fair comparison.\\nBias-only or BitFit is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else.\\nContemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021).\\nPreﬁx-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These spe-\\ncial tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model’s vocabulary. Where\\nto place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on “preﬁxing”, which prepends\\nsuch tokens to the prompt, and “inﬁxing”, which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li &\\nLiang (2021). We use lp (resp. li) denote the number of preﬁx (resp. inﬁx) tokens. The number of\\ntrainable parameters is |Θ| = dmodel × (lp + li).\\nPreﬁx-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to preﬁx-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning\\nthe word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special\\ntokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from pre-\\nvious layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is\\n|Θ| = L × dmodel × (lp + li), where L is the number of Transformer layers.\\nAdapter tuning as proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019) inserts adapter layers between the self-\\nattention module (and the MLP module) and the subsequent residual connection. There are two\\nfully connected layers with biases in an adapter layer with a nonlinearity in between. We call this\\noriginal design AdapterH. Recently, Lin et al. (2020) proposed a more efﬁcient design with the\\nadapter layer applied only after the MLP module and after a LayerNorm. We call it AdapterL. This\\nis very similar to another deign proposed in Pfeiffer et al. (2021), which we call AdapterP. We also\\ninclude another baseline call AdapterDrop (R¨uckl´e et al., 2020) which drops some adapter layers for\\ngreater efﬁciency (AdapterD). We cite numbers from prior works whenever possible to maximize\\nthe number of baselines we compare with; they are in rows with an asterisk (*) in the ﬁrst column.\\nIn all cases, we have |Θ| = ˆLAdpt ×(2×dmodel ×r+r+dmodel)+2× ˆLLN ×dmodel where ˆLAdpt\\nis the number of adapter layers and ˆLLN the number of trainable LayerNorms (e.g., in AdapterL).\\nLoRA adds trainable pairs of rank decomposition matrices in parallel to existing weight matrices.\\nAs mentioned in Section 4.2, we only apply LoRA to Wq and Wv in most experiments for simplicity.\\nThe number of trainable parameters is determined by the rank r and the shape of the original weights:\\n|Θ| = 2 × ˆLLoRA × dmodel × r, where ˆLLoRA is the number of weight matrices we apply LoRA to.\\n6'),\n",

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards\\nsuch as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and\\npopular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners.

We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their\\nsetup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when\\ncomparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length\\nof 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for\\nMRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the ﬁne-tuning baseline.

Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning.\\nWhile GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\\nmodel’s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speciﬁc task Devlin et al. (2019b);\\nRadford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b);\\nCollobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream\\nperformance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform ﬁne-tuning in\\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\\nParameter-Efﬁcient Adaptation.\\nMany have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebufﬁet al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\\nscheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially\\nimprove its parameter efﬁciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed\\noptimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of ﬁne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable\\ngeneralization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al.,\\n2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section.\\nHowever, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which\\ntake up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.\\nLow-Rank Structures in Deep Learning.\\nLow-rank structure is very common in machine learn-\\ning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016;\\nCai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many\\ndeep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned\\nneural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works\\neven explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath\\net al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Kho-\\ndak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works\\nconsiders low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks. In theory liter-\\nature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the\\ncorresponding (ﬁnite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when\\nthe underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li,\\n2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that\\nlow-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed\\nlow-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\\n7\\nUNDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES\\nGiven the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank\\nadaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the\\nhardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives\\nbetter interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We\\nfocus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters\\n(up to 10,000×) without adversely affecting task performances.\\nWe perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter\\nbudget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt\\n9'),\n",

As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only consider weight\\nmatrices in the self-attention module. We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored\\nin FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to r = 8 if we adapt one type of attention weights or\\nr = 4 if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table 5.\\n# of Trainable Parameters = 18M\\nWeight Type\\nWq\\nWk\\nWv\\nWo\\nWq, Wk\\nWq, Wv\\nWq, Wk, Wv, Wo\\nRank r\\n8\\n8\\n8\\n8\\n4\\n4\\n2\\nWikiSQL (±0.5%)\\n70.4\\n70.0\\n73.0\\n73.2\\n71.4\\n73.7\\n73.7\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%)\\n91.0\\n90.8\\n91.0\\n91.3\\n91.3\\n91.3\\n91.7\\nTable 5: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of\\nattention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters. Adapting both Wq and\\nWv gives the best performance overall. We ﬁnd the standard deviation across random seeds to be\\nconsistent for a given dataset, which we report in the ﬁrst column.\\nNote that putting all the parameters in ∆Wq or ∆Wk results in signiﬁcantly lower performance,\\nwhile adapting both Wq and Wv yields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four\\ncaptures enough information in ∆W such that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than\\nadapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.\\n7.2\\nWHAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANK r FOR LORA?\\nWe turn our attention to the effect of rank r on model performance.\\nWe adapt {Wq, Wv},\\n{Wq, Wk, Wv, Wc}, and just Wq for a comparison.\\nWeight Type\\nr = 1\\nr = 2\\nr = 4\\nr = 8\\nr = 64\\nWikiSQL(±0.5%)\\nWq\\n68.8\\n69.6\\n70.5\\n70.4\\n70.0\\nWq, Wv\\n73.4\\n73.3\\n73.7\\n73.8\\n73.5\\nWq, Wk, Wv, Wo\\n74.1\\n73.7\\n74.0\\n74.0\\n73.9\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%)\\nWq\\n90.7\\n90.9\\n91.1\\n90.7\\n90.7\\nWq, Wv\\n91.3\\n91.4\\n91.3\\n91.6\\n91.4\\nWq, Wk, Wv, Wo\\n91.2\\n91.7\\n91.7\\n91.5\\n91.4\\nTable 6: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI with different rank r. To our surprise, a\\nrank as small as one sufﬁces for adapting both Wq and Wv on these datasets while training Wq alone\\nneeds a larger r. We conduct a similar experiment on GPT-2 in Section H.2.\\nTable 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small r (more\\nso for {Wq, Wv} than just Wq). This suggests the update matrix ∆W could have a very small\\n“intrinsic rank”.6 To further support this ﬁnding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by\\ndifferent choices of r and by different random seeds. We argue that increasing r does not cover a\\nmore meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufﬁcient.\\n6However, we do not expect a small r to work for every task or dataset. Consider the following thought\\nexperiment: if the downstream task were in a different language than the one used for pre-training, retraining\\nthe entire model (similar to LoRA with r = dmodel) could certainly outperform LoRA with a small r.\\n10'),\n",

First, ∆W has a stronger correlation with W compared\\nto a random matrix, indicating that ∆W ampliﬁes some features that are already in W. Second,\\ninstead of repeating the top singular directions of W, ∆W only ampliﬁes directions that are not\\nemphasized in W. Third, the ampliﬁcation factor is rather huge: 21.5 ≈6.91/0.32 for r = 4.\\nSee Section H.4 for why r = 64 has a smaller ampliﬁcation factor. We also provide a visualization\\nin Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from Wq.\\nThis suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially ampliﬁes the important features for\\nspeciﬁc downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nFine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required\\nand the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose\\nLoRA, an efﬁcient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input\\nsequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching\\nwhen deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused\\non Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural\\nnetworks with dense layers.\\nThere are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efﬁcient adapta-\\ntion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind ﬁne-tuning\\nor LoRA is far from clear – how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well\\non downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full ﬁne-\\n12'),\n",

Consequently,\\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\\nlatency. While as pointed out in R¨uckl´e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\\nhardware parallelism. We conﬁrm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium\\nand point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where\\nthe added latency can be signiﬁcant.\\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging\\nover 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension\\nr. We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH,\\nand a recent, more efﬁcient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterL. See Section 5.1\\nfor more details on the designs. We plot the slow-down in percentage compared to the no-adapter\\nbaseline in Figure 5.\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n0\\n10\\n100\\n250\\nAdapterH r\\nSeq Len = 128\\nSeq Len = 256\\nSeq Len = 512\\n1\\n2\\n4\\n8\\n16\\n32\\nBatch Size\\n0\\n10\\n100\\n250\\nAdapterL r\\n1\\n2\\n4\\n8\\n16\\n32\\nBatch Size\\n1\\n2\\n4\\n8\\n16\\n32\\nBatch Size\\nFigure 5: Percentage slow-down of inference latency compared to the no-adapter (r = 0) baseline.\\nThe top row shows the result for AdapterH and the bottom row AdapterL.

The focus is on\\nidentifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\\nF.3\\nLOW-DATA REGIME\\nTo evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly\\nsample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data\\nMNLI-n tasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\\nn. To our surprise, PreﬁxEmbed and PreﬁxLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with\\nPreﬁxEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PreﬁxLayer\\nperforms better than PreﬁxEmbed but is still signiﬁcantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-\\n100. The gap between preﬁx-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in-\\ncrease the number of training examples, which might suggest that preﬁx-based approaches are not\\nsuitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than ﬁne-tuning on both\\nMNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the\\n(±0.3) variance due to random seeds.\\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Ta-\\nble 17.

(Recall UU ⊤WV ⊤V\\ngives the “projection” of W onto the subspace spanned by ∆W.)\\nIntuitively, when ∆W mostly contains task-speciﬁc directions, this quantity measures how much of\\nthem are ampliﬁed by ∆W. As shown in Section 7.3, for r = 4, this ampliﬁcation factor is as large\\nas 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the\\nentire feature space from the pre-trained model W), that need to be ampliﬁed by a very large factor\\n20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream speciﬁc task. And, one should\\nexpect a very different set of feature directions to be ampliﬁed for each different downstream task.\\nOne may notice, however, for r = 64, this ampliﬁcation factor is only around 2, meaning that\\nmost directions learned in ∆W with r = 64 are not being ampliﬁed by much. This should not\\nbe surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank needed to represent\\nthe “task-speciﬁc directions” (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the\\nrank-4 version of ∆W (corresponding to r = 4) are ampliﬁed by a much larger factor 20.\\n25'),\n",
