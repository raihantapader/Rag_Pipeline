Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Raihan Tapader, Md. Mostafizer Rahman, Ariful Islam Shiplu, Md Faizul Ibne Amin, and Yutaka Watanobe\\nAbstract—In today’s world, the focus of programmers has\\nshifted from writing complex, error-prone code to prioritizing\\nsimple, clear, efficient, and sustainable code that makes programs\\neasier to understand. Code refactoring plays a critical role\\nin this transition by improving structural organization and\\noptimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods\\nare limited in their ability to generalize across multiple pro-\\ngramming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on\\nmanually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this\\nstudy are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)\\n-based framework capable of performing accurate and effi-\\ncient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#,\\nPython, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering\\n(Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-\\ntuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality\\nimprovements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity,\\nNumber of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in\\nrefactored code through empirical metrics and human assess-\\nment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-\\nengineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for\\nmultilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that\\nJava achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the\\n10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of\\n94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high\\nsimilarity (≈53–54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance\\nbetween structural modifications and semantic preservation.\\nPython exhibits the lowest structural distance across all shots\\n(≈277–294) while achieving moderate similarity (≈44–48%) that\\nindicates consistent and minimally disruptive refactoring. C#\\nconsistently preserves semantic content, achieving up to 57.63%\\nsimilarity at 10-shot, despite larger structural changes. C and\\nC++ show moderate distances (≈266–338) and variable similarity\\n(36–55%), reflecting more unpredictable outcomes.\\nIndex Terms—Large Language Model, prompt engineering,\\ncode refactoring, API, fine-tuning, zero-shot prompting, few-shot\\nprompting.\\nI.

However, achieving this balance has become significant\\nchallenge because reducing execution time often increases\\nmemory uses, and vice versa. To address this, programmers\\ncontinuously work on refactoring their code, improving earlier\\nversions by removing redundancies, reducing the number of\\nlines and tokens, and making the logic clearer. Code refac-\\ntoring not only enhances performance but also improves code\\nreadability, maintainability, and adaptability to future changes\\nas shown in Figure 1.\\nOver the few decades, code refactoring has evolved from\\nbeing a purely manual and experience-driven practice to a\\nsystematic process supported by automated tools and frame-\\nworks. Early refactoring methods focused mainly on syntactic\\ntransformations, such as renaming variables, extracting meth-\\nods, or eliminating duplicate code. Tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ\\nIDEA, and other integrated development environments (IDEs)\\nhave helped standardize these transformation for making them\\naccessible to a broader range of developers. However, as\\nsoftware systems have grown in size and complexity, the\\nlimitations of purely rule-based approaches have become ap-\\nparent. Researchers have explored program analysis techniques\\nsuch as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs\\n(CFGs), and static analysis to detect code smells and suggest\\nimprovements.\\nMore recently, machine learning and deep learning models\\nhave been applied to learn refactoring patterns from large-scale\\nrepositories to move beyond the surface-level changes toward\\ndeeper structural and semantic optimization [1]–[3].

Each prompt consists of three\\nkey components: a custom instruction that highlights specific\\nfeatures as illustrated in Figure 4, along with a complex code\\nsnippet and its corresponding refactored version. Next, we\\noutline the prompting strategies employed in our methodology,\\nwhich include zero-shot, two-shot, four-shot, and few-shot\\nprompting. In zero-shot prompting, only the instruction is\\nprovided without any accompanying examples. Conversely,\\ntwo-shot, four-shot, and few-shot prompting incorporate two,\\nfour, and several relevant examples respectively, alongside\\nthe instruction. During the learning phase, the input code\\nis supplied to a large language model (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo)\\ntogether with few-shot examples for instruction fine-tuning.\\nThe model learns the transformation patterns from the prompts\\nFig. 3: Demonstration of model behavior: (1) instruction inter-\\npertation, (2) refactoring responses to input program based on\\nsystem instructions, and (3) error handling proficiency when\\nrefactoring erroneous program.

EXPERIMENTALRESULTS\\nIn this section, we present the evaluation metrics employed\\nto assess the quality of the refactored code and discuss the\\nexperimental results obtained from applying our proposed\\napproach.\\nA. Matrics\\n1) Pass@k:is a metric for evaluating thefunctional cor-\\nrectnessof generated programs by estimating the probability,\\nintroduced by Chen et al. [8]. It is defined in Equation 1,\\nwherenis the total samples,cis the correct samples, andk\\nis the evaluated samples, satisfyingn≥kandc≤nrules.\\nSpecifically, Pass@1 measures how often the first output is\\ncorrect, while Pass@10 checks if at least one of the top 10\\noutputs is correct [12].\\nPass@k:=E\\n\"\\n1−\\n\\x00n−c\\nk\\n\\x01\\n\\x00n\\nk\\n\\x01\\n#\\n(1)\\n2) Correct@k:In this paper, we createCorrect@kmetric\\nas the ratio of correct outputs among the top-kgenerated\\nresults using few-shot prompting, as shown in Equation 2.\\nThis metric is specifically designed to assess the correctness of\\nthekgenerated samples, wherenrepresents the total number\\nof generated outputs,edenotes the number of erroneous\\nones, and(n−e)indicates the number of correct outputs.\\nThe parameterkcontrols the level at which correctness is\\nmeasured.\\nCorrect@k=\\n(\\n100%, k≤(n−e),\\nn−e\\nk , k >(n−e). (2)\\nFor each new input code snippetC i, we generaten= 5\\nrefactored versions and evaluate correctness usingCorrect@k,\\nwherek∈ {1,2, . . . ,5}. In this work, Correct@1 refers to\\nthe proportion in which at least one of the generated outputs\\nis correct, whereas Correct@5 reflects the cases where all\\nfive outputs are correct. Subsequently, if a generated codeR i\\nsatisfies the correctness criteria defined by the equation, the\\nsuccess rate is computed accordingly.\\n3) McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity(CC):is a software\\nmetric used to measure the number of linearly indepen-\\ndent paths through a program’s source code. It quantifies\\nthe program complexity by counting the number of deci-\\nsion points(e.g., if statements, while loops, for loops, switch\\nstatements) in the code [17]. A lower CC is preferable and\\nmakes the code easier to understand and maintain in software\\ndevelopment. We employed a custom AST-based library to\\naccurately compute the CC for both correct and incorrect code\\nsamples.\\n4) Compilability:refers to whether a generated program is\\nsyntactically correct and successfully compiles, reflecting the\\nmodel’s capabilities to produce valid and executable code It\\nis calculated as equation 3:\\nCompilability=\\n\\x10 P\\nP+E\\n\\x11\\n×100%(3)\\nwhere P denotes the number of programs that compile\\nsuccessfully, and E denotes the number of programs that\\nfail to compile. In our case, the comparability of the com-\\nplex(original) programs used for refactoring is 100%, as all of\\nthem were correct and problem-solved.\\n5) Lines of Code (LOC):is a software metric that measures\\nthe number of lines in a source code. In this work, we use\\nSource Lines of Code (SLOC), which excludes comments,\\nblank lines, and structural braces (e.g.,{ }), focusing solely\\non the actual executable statements. For refactoring analysis,\\nSLOC is preferred over raw LOC because it avoids inflated\\ncounts from non-functional lines and gives a more accurate\\npicture of the actual number of lines and logic implemented\\nrather than comments or empty lines.\\n6) Chars:refers to the total length of how much character\\nis used in a code on average. This matrix sometimes yields\\nanomalous values due to long string literals, comments, and\\nexcessive whitespace. To accurately measure the character\\nlength, we normalize the refactored code by removing such\\nanomalies. For example, consider the string literals:\\nA=’Enter a num:’ and B= ”H”; these would initially result in\\ndifferent character counts. However, after normalization, both\\nare treated equivalently as A = ’ ’ and B = ” ”, leading to\\nconsistent and fair character length comparisons.\\n7) Tokens:refers to the total length of how many tokens\\nare used in a code on average. Tokens are the fundamental\\ncomponents of a program that the compiler processes. In this\\nwork, we used an official Python tokenizer for Python code,\\nwhile for other languages, we employed a regex-based tok-\\nenizer. To ensure accurate token counts, all code snippets are\\nnormalized by removing comments, newlines, and indentation\\nbefore tokenization.\\n8) Levenshtein Distance:also known as edit distance, is\\na string metric that quantifies the difference between two\\nsequences (typically strings) by counting the minimum number\\nof single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions)\\nrequired to transform one string into the other.

Results\\nWe conducted comprehensive experiments across multiple\\nprogramming languages using a fine-tuned large language\\nmodel with few-shot prompting to assess its effectiveness in\\nautomated code refactoring. Table I summarizes key code qual-\\nity metrics—Compilability, CC, LOC, Chars, and token count\\nfor five programming languages (C, C++, C#, Python, and\\nJava) evaluated under different few-shot prompting scenarios\\nranging from 0-shot to 10-shot.\\nIn the 0-shot baseline, compilability ranges narrowly be-\\ntween 88.67% (C#) and 92.67% (C++) which indicates that\\neven without examples, the model maintains reasonable syn-\\ntactic consistency. CC is relatively stable for C, C++, and C#\\naround 5.0, while Python and Java generate simpler control\\nflows with lower complexity 2.10 and 3.32, respectively. The\\nrefactored programs at this stage are compact, mostly between\\n6–8 lines of code and 200–290 characters, with Python being\\nthe most concise in token count 123.71. Introducing two\\nexample prompts significantly alters the compilability trends\\nacross languages. While C experiences a decline to 83%\\ncompilability, higher-level managed languages such as C#,\\nPython, and Java demonstrate notable improvements, reaching\\ncompilability rates of 94% and above. Concurrently, LOC\\nincrease modestly for all languages, with particularly pro-\\nnounced growth in C# (11.02 lines) and Java (8.59 lines),\\nreflecting longer and potentially more detailed function im-\\nplementations. Corresponding increases are also observed in\\ncharacter and token counts, consistent with the enhanced\\ncode elaboration. At the 4-shot prompting level, compilability\\nstabilizes across languages, with C# achieving the highest rate\\nof 97.33%. Python’s CC further decreases to 1.79, indicating\\nthe generation of highly linear and simplified code structures.\\nMeanwhile, C++ and Java exhibit increased verbosity, each\\nsurpassing 260 characters on average. C# continues to show\\nthe greatest increase in LOC, reaching 11.64 lines, suggesting\\nthat the model tends to produce more descriptive or boilerplate\\ncode when provided with additional contextual examples.

In terms of\\nsimilarity, C# consistently achieves the highest mean values,\\npeaking at 57.63% under 10-shot prompting that indicates\\nthat despite larger structural changes, the semantic and lexical\\ncontent is largely retained. Java also maintains high similarity\\nvalues at higher shots (≈53–54%) that highlights its ability to\\nbalance structural changes with semantic preservation.

C and C++ display\\nvariable similarity across shots, with mean values ranging\\nfrom 36% to 55% that reflects less predictable outcomes\\ndepending on the shot configuration. Examining shot-wise\\ntrends, low-shot settings (0–2 shots) generally result in higher\\ndistances and lower similarity for most languages which\\nsuggests that minimal examples are insufficient to guide the\\nmodel effectively.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\\n3'),\n",

Contributions\\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\n• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\\na preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\\nsolving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\\nlong CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\\nfirst open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\\npurely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\\nadvancements in this area.\\n• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\\nstages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\\nerences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and\\nnon-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating\\nbetter models.\\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\\n• We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller\\nmodels, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered\\nthrough RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit\\nthe research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\\n• Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models\\nthat are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that\\nthe distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview.

Approach\\n2.1. Overview\\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model\\nperformance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly\\nimproved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with\\nthe inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1)\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and\\n(2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of\\nlong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to\\nsmall dense models.\\n2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data,\\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\\nGroup Relative Policy OptimizationIn order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\\nSpecifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, ··· , 𝑜𝐺}from the old\\npolicy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:\\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃)= E[𝑞∼𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\\n𝑖=1 ∼𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑂|𝑞)]\\n1\\n𝐺\\n𝐺∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n\\x12\\nmin\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)𝐴𝑖, clip\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞), 1−𝜀, 1+𝜀\\n\\x13\\n𝐴𝑖\\n\\x13\\n−𝛽D𝐾𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x01\\x13\\n, (1)\\nD𝐾𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x01 =\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) −log\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) −1, (2)\\nwhere 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴𝑖 is the advantage, computed using a group of\\nrewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, ... , 𝑟𝐺}corresponding to the outputs within each group:\\n𝐴𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 −m𝑒𝑎𝑛({𝑟1, 𝑟2, ··· , 𝑟𝐺})\\ns𝑡𝑑({𝑟1, 𝑟2, ··· , 𝑟𝐺}) .

Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be\\nused to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\\n• Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward\\nmodel that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’\\ntags.\\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,\\nbecause we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale\\nreinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training\\nresources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\\n2.2.3. Training Template\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides\\nthe base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template\\nrequires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.\\nWe intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific\\nbiases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-\\ngies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL\\nprocess.\\n2.2.4.

For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,\\nand language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the\\nopen community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly\\ncold-start data.\\n2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can\\nreasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small\\namount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that\\nnot only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong\\ngeneral capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The\\npipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\\n2.3.1. Cold Start\\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from\\nthe base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data\\nto fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several\\napproaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting\\nmodels to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human\\nannotators.\\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as\\nthe starting point for RL.

In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1,\\nwe design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and\\nfilters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as\\n|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning\\nprocess is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning\\nresults.\\n• Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we\\nobserve better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is\\na better way for reasoning models.\\n2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale\\nreinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses\\non enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such\\nas coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with\\nclear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,\\nparticularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language\\nmixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated\\nas the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show\\nthat such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward\\naligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of\\nreasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the\\nfinal reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence\\non reasoning tasks.\\n2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT\\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which\\nprimarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the\\nmodel’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we\\ngenerate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\\nReasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-\\ning rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,\\nwe only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,\\nwe expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward\\nmodel by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.\\nAdditionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have\\nfiltered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks.

Specifically, we train the model using a combination\\nof reward signals and diverse prompt distributions.

In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts\\nare few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot\\nmay hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation\\nprotocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the\\nHumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++,\\nC#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP , and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated\\nusing CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces\\ndataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases,\\nafter which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench\\nverified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related\\nbenchmarks are measured using a \"diff\" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum\\nof 32,768 tokens for each benchmark.\\nBaselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including\\nDeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nSince accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its perfor-\\nmance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).\\nEvaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models.\\nWe found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in\\nhigher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we\\ndefault to pass@𝑘evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature.\\nSpecifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top- 𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘\\nresponses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1\\nis then calculated as\\npass@1 = 1\\n𝑘\\n𝑘∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑝𝑖,\\nwhere 𝑝𝑖 denotes the correctness of the 𝑖-th response. This method provides more reliable\\nperformance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang\\net al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64.\\n1https://aider.chat\\n2https://codeforces.com\\n3https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html\\n12'),\n",

This im-\\nprovement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where signif-\\nicant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1\\nexcels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis\\ncapabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data\\nanalysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,\\ndemonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where\\nOpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than\\nDeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse\\nanswering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an\\naccuracy of over 70%.\\nDeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a\\nmodel’s ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion\\nof instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL\\ntraining. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard,\\nindicating DeepSeek-R1’s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its\\nsignificant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale\\nRL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse\\ndomains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an\\naverage of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that\\n13'),\n",

However, DeepSeek-R1-\\nDistill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.\\nTherefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller\\nones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in\\nthis paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance\\nof distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing\\nbeyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-\\nscale reinforcement learning.\\n4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts\\nIn the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along\\nthe way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that\\nthese approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\\nProcess Reward Model (PRM)PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better\\napproaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\\n2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\\nability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\\net al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\\nintroduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-\\nver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time\\ncompute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,\\nunlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\\n15'),\n",

To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\\nnode, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\\ndirectly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\\nTraining a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\\nmodel to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to\\nprogressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\\ndue to the complexities of token generation.\\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\\npre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\\nsignificant challenge.\\n5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\\nlearning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\\ndata, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\\nleveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\\nWe further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use\\nDeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small\\ndense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o\\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other\\ndense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-\\ntuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\\n• General Capability:Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3\\nin tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output.\\nMoving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in\\nthese fields.\\n• Language Mixing:DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which\\nmay result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For\\ninstance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is\\nin a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future\\nupdates.\\n• Prompting Engineering:When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive\\nto prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we\\nrecommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a\\nzero-shot setting for optimal results.\\n• Software Engineering Tasks:Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the effi-\\nciency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software\\nengineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement\\nover DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address\\nthis by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating\\nasynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.\\n16'),\n",

As\\nwe pre-train larger models, full ﬁne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example – deploying indepen-\\ndent instances of ﬁne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\\nexpensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B ﬁne-tuned with Adam,\\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times.

(2020) which show that the learned\\nover-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the\\nchange in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed\\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural\\nnetwork indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during\\nadaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3\\n175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e.,r in Figure 1 can be one or two) sufﬁces even\\nwhen the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efﬁcient.\\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\\n• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-\\nferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efﬁciently switch tasks by replacing the\\nmatrices Aand B in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-\\nhead signiﬁcantly.\\n• LoRA makes training more efﬁcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\\n• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully ﬁne-tuned model, by\\nconstruction.\\n• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\\nas preﬁx-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\\nTerminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output di-\\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel. We use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the\\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-\\ntrained weight matrix and ∆W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to\\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 ×dmodel.\\n2 P ROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speciﬁc prompt.\\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model PΦ(y|x) parametrized by Φ.\\nFor instance, PΦ(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\\nreading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is\\nrepresented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z= {(xi,yi)}i=1,..,N, where both xi and\\nyi are sequences of tokens.

Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efﬁcient. See Sec-\\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to efﬁcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\\net al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R¨uckl´e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus\\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\\ning multi-task settings (R ¨uckl´e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\\nthe extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep-\\nikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as\\nAllReduce and Broadcast, unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exempliﬁed by preﬁx tuning (Li\\n& Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that preﬁx tuning is difﬁcult to optimize\\nand that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, conﬁrming similar\\nobservations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for\\nadaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which\\nwe suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study\\non task performance to Section 5.\\n3'),\n",

See the full study in Appendix B.\\n4 O UR METHOD\\nWe describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical beneﬁts. The principles outlined here apply\\nto any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer\\nlanguage models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\\n4.1 L OW-RANK -PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES\\nA neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight\\nmatrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a speciﬁc task, Aghajanyan et al.\\n(2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low “instrisic dimension” and can still\\nlearn efﬁciently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothe-\\nsize the updates to the weights also have a low “intrinsic rank” during adaptation. For a pre-trained\\nweight matrix W0 ∈Rd×k, we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank de-\\ncomposition W0 + ∆W = W0 + BA, where B ∈Rd×r,A ∈Rr×k, and the rank r ≪min(d,k).\\nDuring training, W0 is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, whileAand Bcontain trainable\\nparameters. Note both W0 and ∆W = BAare multiplied with the same input, and their respective\\noutput vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h= W0x, our modiﬁed forward pass yields:\\nh= W0x+ ∆Wx = W0x+ BAx (3)\\nWe illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for Aand\\nzero for B, so ∆W = BAis zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ∆Wx by α\\nr, where α\\nis a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning αis roughly the same as tuning the learning\\nrate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set α to the ﬁrst r we try\\nand do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary\\nr(Yang & Hu, 2021).\\nA Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of ﬁne-tuning allows the training of\\na subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumu-\\nlated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when\\napplying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases 2, we roughly recover the expressive-\\nness of full ﬁne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank rto the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In\\nother words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3, training LoRA roughly converges\\nto training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and preﬁx-based\\nmethods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\\nNo Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and\\nstore W = W0 + BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0 and BA are in Rd×k.\\nWhen we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0 by subtracting BA and\\nthen adding a different B′A′, a quick operation with very little memory overhead. Critically, this\\n2They represent a negligible number of parameters compared to weights.\\n3An inevitability when adapting to hard tasks.\\n4'),\n",

In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in\\nthe self-attention module (Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treatWq (or Wk, Wv)\\nas a single matrix of dimension dmodel×dmodel, even though the output dimension is usually sliced\\ninto attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream\\ntasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity\\nand parameter-efﬁciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight\\nmatrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP\\nlayers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\\nPractical Beneﬁts and Limitations. The most signiﬁcant beneﬁt comes from the reduction in\\nmemory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM\\nusage by up to 2/3 if r ≪dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen\\nparameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to\\n350GB. With r= 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint\\nsize is reduced by roughly 10,000 ×(from 350GB to 35MB) 4. This allows us to train with signiﬁ-\\ncantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another beneﬁt is that we can switch between tasks\\nwhile deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the\\nparameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out\\non the ﬂy on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup\\nduring training on GPT-3 175B compared to full ﬁne-tuning 5 as we do not need to calculate the\\ngradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\\nLoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks\\nwith differentAand Bin a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorbAand Binto W to eliminate\\nadditional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose\\nthe LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\\n5 E MPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nWe evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), De-\\nBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown\\net al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding\\n(NLU) to generation (NLG). Speciﬁcally, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark\\nfor RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct com-\\nparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al.,\\n2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for\\nmore details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\\n5.1 B ASELINES\\nTo compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their\\nreported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear\\nin certain experiments.\\nFine-Tuning (FT)is a common approach for adaptation. During ﬁne-tuning, the model is initialized\\nto the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple\\nvariant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported\\nin prior work (Li & Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers (FTTop2).\\n4We still need the 350GB model during deployment; however, storing 100 adapted models only requires\\n350GB + 35MB * 100 ≈354GB as opposed to 100 * 350GB ≈35TB.\\n5For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full ﬁne-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same\\nnumber of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.\\n5'),\n",

These spe-\\ncial tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model’s vocabulary. Where\\nto place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on “preﬁxing”, which prepends\\nsuch tokens to the prompt, and “inﬁxing”, which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li &\\nLiang (2021). We use lp (resp. li) denote the number of preﬁx (resp. inﬁx) tokens. The number of\\ntrainable parameters is |Θ|= dmodel ×(lp + li).\\nPreﬁx-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to preﬁx-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning\\nthe word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special\\ntokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer.

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards\\nsuch as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and\\npopular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base\\n(125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020)\\nand evaluate the performance of different efﬁcient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE\\nbenchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their\\nsetup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when\\ncomparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length\\nof 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for\\nMRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the ﬁne-tuning baseline.

Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\\nmodel’s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speciﬁc task Devlin et al. (2019b);\\nRadford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b);\\nCollobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream\\nperformance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform ﬁne-tuning in\\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\\nParameter-Efﬁcient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\\nscheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially\\nimprove its parameter efﬁciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed\\noptimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of ﬁne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable\\ngeneralization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al.,\\n2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section.\\nHowever, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which\\ntake up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.\\nLow-Rank Structures in Deep Learning. Low-rank structure is very common in machine learn-\\ning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016;\\nCai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many\\ndeep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned\\nneural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works\\neven explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath\\net al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Kho-\\ndak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works\\nconsiders low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks . In theory liter-\\nature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the\\ncorresponding (ﬁnite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when\\nthe underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li,\\n2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that\\nlow-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed\\nlow-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\\n7 U NDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES\\nGiven the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank\\nadaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the\\nhardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives\\nbetter interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We\\nfocus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters\\n(up to 10,000×) without adversely affecting task performances.\\nWe perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter\\nbudget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt\\n9'),\n",

As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only consider weight\\nmatrices in the self-attention module. We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored\\nin FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to r = 8 if we adapt one type of attention weights or\\nr= 4 if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table 5.\\n# of Trainable Parameters = 18M\\nWeight Type Wq Wk Wv Wo Wq,Wk Wq,Wv Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo\\nRank r 8 8 8 8 4 4 2\\nWikiSQL (±0.5%) 70.4 70.0 73.0 73.2 71.4 73.7 73.7\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%) 91.0 90.8 91.0 91.3 91.3 91.3 91.7\\nTable 5: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of\\nattention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters. Adapting both Wq and\\nWv gives the best performance overall. We ﬁnd the standard deviation across random seeds to be\\nconsistent for a given dataset, which we report in the ﬁrst column.\\nNote that putting all the parameters in ∆Wq or ∆Wk results in signiﬁcantly lower performance,\\nwhile adapting both Wq and Wv yields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four\\ncaptures enough information in ∆W such that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than\\nadapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.\\n7.2 W HAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANK rFOR LORA?\\nWe turn our attention to the effect of rank r on model performance. We adapt {Wq,Wv},\\n{Wq,Wk,Wv,Wc}, and just Wq for a comparison.\\nWeight Type r= 1 r= 2 r= 4 r= 8 r= 64\\nWikiSQL(±0.5%) Wq 68.8 69.6 70.5 70.4 70.0\\nWq,Wv 73.4 73.3 73.7 73.8 73.5\\nWq,Wk,Wv,Wo 74.1 73.7 74.0 74.0 73.9\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%)\\nWq 90.7 90.9 91.1 90.7 90.7\\nWq,Wv 91.3 91.4 91.3 91.6 91.4\\nWq,Wk,Wv,Wo 91.2 91.7 91.7 91.5 91.4\\nTable 6: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI with different rank r.

We conduct a similar experiment on GPT-2 in Section H.2.\\nTable 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small r (more\\nso for {Wq,Wv}than just Wq). This suggests the update matrix ∆W could have a very small\\n“intrinsic rank”.6 To further support this ﬁnding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by\\ndifferent choices of r and by different random seeds. We argue that increasing r does not cover a\\nmore meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufﬁcient.\\n6However, we do not expect a small r to work for every task or dataset. Consider the following thought\\nexperiment: if the downstream task were in a different language than the one used for pre-training, retraining\\nthe entire model (similar to LoRA with r= dmodel) could certainly outperform LoRA with a small r.\\n10'),\n",

This can shed light on the\\nunderlying mechanism for adapting pre-trained language models.\\nTo answer these questions, we project W onto the r-dimensional subspace of ∆W by comput-\\ning U⊤WV ⊤, with U/V being the left/right singular-vector matrix of ∆W. Then, we com-\\npare the Frobenius norm between ∥U⊤WV ⊤∥F and ∥W∥F. As a comparison, we also compute\\n∥U⊤WV ⊤∥F by replacing U,V with the top rsingular vectors of W or a random matrix.\\nr= 4 r= 64\\n∆Wq Wq Random ∆Wq Wq Random\\n||U⊤WqV⊤||F = 0.32 21.67 0.02 1.90 37.71 0.33\\n||Wq||F = 61.95 ||∆Wq||F = 6.91 ||∆Wq||F = 3.57\\nTable 7: The Frobenius norm of U⊤WqV⊤where U and V are the left/right top rsingular vector\\ndirections of either (1) ∆Wq, (2) Wq, or (3) a random matrix. The weight matrices are taken from\\nthe 48th layer of GPT-3.\\nWe draw several conclusions from Table 7. First, ∆W has a stronger correlation with W compared\\nto a random matrix, indicating that ∆W ampliﬁes some features that are already in W. Second,\\ninstead of repeating the top singular directions of W, ∆W only ampliﬁes directions that are not\\nemphasized in W. Third, the ampliﬁcation factor is rather huge: 21.5 ≈6.91/0.32 for r = 4 .\\nSee Section H.4 for why r = 64 has a smaller ampliﬁcation factor. We also provide a visualization\\nin Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions fromWq.\\nThis suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially ampliﬁes the important features for\\nspeciﬁc downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model.\\n8 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nFine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required\\nand the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose\\nLoRA, an efﬁcient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input\\nsequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching\\nwhen deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused\\non Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural\\nnetworks with dense layers.\\nThere are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efﬁcient adapta-\\ntion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind ﬁne-tuning\\nor LoRA is far from clear – how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well\\non downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full ﬁne-\\n12'),\n",

Consequently,\\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\\nlatency. While as pointed out in R ¨uckl´e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\\nhardware parallelism. We conﬁrm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium\\nand point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where\\nthe added latency can be signiﬁcant.\\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging\\nover 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension\\nr. We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call Adapter H,\\nand a recent, more efﬁcient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call Adapter L. See Section 5.1\\nfor more details on the designs.

The individual datasets\\nare released under different permissive licenses.\\nWikiSQL is introduced in Zhong et al. (2017) and contains 56,355/8,421 training/validation ex-\\namples. The task is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and table schemata.\\nWe encode context as x = {table schema,query}and target as y = {SQL}. The dataset is release\\nunder the BSD 3-Clause License.\\nSAMSum is introduced in Gliwa et al. (2019) and contains 14,732/819 training/test examples. It\\nconsists of staged chat conversations between two people and corresponding abstractive summaries\\nwritten by linguists. We encode context as ” \\\\n” concatenated utterances followed by a ” \\\\n\\\\n”,\\nand target as y = {summary}. The dataset is released under the non-commercial licence: Creative\\nCommons BY-NC-ND 4.0.\\nE2E NLG Challenge was ﬁrst introduced in Novikova et al. (2017) as a dataset for training end-to-\\nend, data-driven natural language generation systems and is commonly used for data-to-text evalua-\\ntion. The E2E dataset consists of roughly 42,000 training, 4,600 validation, and 4,600 test exam-\\nples from the restaurant domain. Each source table used as input can have multiple references. Each\\nsample input (x,y) consists of a sequence of slot-value pairs, along with a corresponding natural\\nlanguage reference text.

With\\n22K examples in total WebNLG comprises 14 distinct categories, nine of which are seen during\\ntraining. Since ﬁve of the 14 total categories are not seen during training, but are represented in\\nthe test set, evaluation is typically broken out by “seen” categories (S), “unseen” categories (U)\\nand “all” (A).

The focus is on\\nidentifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\\nF.3 L OW-DATA REGIME\\nTo evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly\\nsample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data\\nMNLI-ntasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\\nn. To our surprise, PreﬁxEmbed and PreﬁxLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with\\nPreﬁxEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PreﬁxLayer\\nperforms better than PreﬁxEmbed but is still signiﬁcantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-\\n100. The gap between preﬁx-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in-\\ncrease the number of training examples, which might suggest that preﬁx-based approaches are not\\nsuitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than ﬁne-tuning on both\\nMNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the\\n(±0.3) variance due to random seeds.\\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Ta-\\nble 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PreﬁxLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does\\nnot decrease with a larger learning rate.\\nG M EASURING SIMILARITY BETWEEN SUBSPACES\\nIn this paper we use the measure φ(A,B,i,j ) = ψ(Ui\\nA,Uj\\nB) = ∥Ui⊤\\nA UB∥2\\nF\\nmin{i,j} to measure the subspace\\nsimilarity between two column orthonormal matrices Ui\\nA ∈Rd×i and Uj\\nB ∈Rd×j, obtained by\\ntaking columns of the left singular matrices of Aand B.

As shown in Section 7.3, for r= 4, this ampliﬁcation factor is as large\\nas 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the\\nentire feature space from the pre-trained model W), that need to be ampliﬁed by a very large factor\\n20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream speciﬁc task. And, one should\\nexpect a very different set of feature directions to be ampliﬁed for each different downstream task.\\nOne may notice, however, for r = 64 , this ampliﬁcation factor is only around 2, meaning that\\nmost directions learned in ∆W with r = 64 are not being ampliﬁed by much. This should not\\nbe surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank needed to represent\\nthe “task-speciﬁc directions” (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the\\nrank-4 version of ∆W (corresponding to r= 4) are ampliﬁed by a much larger factor 20.\\n25'),\n",

Raihan Tapader, Md. Mostafizer Rahman, Ariful Islam Shiplu, Md Faizul Ibne Amin, and Yutaka Watanobe\\nAbstract—In today’s world, the focus of programmers has\\nshifted from writing complex, error-prone code to prioritizing\\nsimple, clear, efficient, and sustainable code that makes programs\\neasier to understand. Code refactoring plays a critical role\\nin this transition by improving structural organization and\\noptimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods\\nare limited in their ability to generalize across multiple pro-\\ngramming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on\\nmanually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this\\nstudy are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)\\n-based framework capable of performing accurate and effi-\\ncient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#,\\nPython, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering'),\n",

Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline.

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences'),\n",

Code refactoring plays a critical role\\nin this transition by improving structural organization and\\noptimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods\\nare limited in their ability to generalize across multiple pro-\\ngramming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on\\nmanually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this\\nstudy are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)\\n-based framework capable of performing accurate and effi-\\ncient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#,\\nPython, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering'),\n",

Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline.

Contributions\\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\n• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\\na preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\\nsolving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\\nlong CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\\nfirst open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\\npurely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\\nadvancements in this area.\\n• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\\nstages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\\nerences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and',\n",

       "  'content': 'behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection—where the model\\nrevisits and reevaluates its previous steps—and the exploration of alternative approaches to\\nproblem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead\\nemerge as a result of the model’s interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This\\nspontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s reasoning capabilities,\\nenabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.\\nAha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-ZeroA particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during\\nthe training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as\\nillustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase,\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial\\napproach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities',\n",
