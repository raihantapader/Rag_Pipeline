Machine Learning Basics

    Machine Learning (ML) basics involve teaching computers to learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming, using key types like Supervised (labeled data), 
    Unsupervised (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (trial-and-error for rewards). The core process involves data preparation, algorithm training (representation, optimization, evaluation), 
    and model testing, with goals like generalization to real-world data, leading to applications from spam filters to recommendation systems.
